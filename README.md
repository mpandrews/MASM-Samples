# MASM-Samples

This is the source for a trio of programs I wrote in MASM for assignments; I've included only the .asm sources themselves.  Both depend on the Irvine libraries (as might be expected) which I don't have the rights to distribute, so they're not directly assemblable as-is.

The main highlights, (from my perspective) are probably the ParseGeometry routine in program four, which directly calls the Windows console API, and the heapsort in program five.

The course number has been redacted from all the files, to avoid people googling them.
